Stacks and Queues

To understand the concept of Stacks, we can consider a real life example such as A stack of books placed on a table which I never read in my case! Here the books placed on top of one another is a representation of a stack(that's why it is called as a stack of books Duh'). The first book will be taken out first, it follows LIFO principle meaning Last In First Out. A new book can be added at the top and the same book has to be removed. This is a simple explanation of a Stack.

For Queue, off course we all know what a queue is, it's the same here as well. Queue is nothing but standing in line in a movie theatre for the expensive popcorn. First guy enters the queue gets it first and the last guy gets it at the very last in an ideal scenario unless you start a new line and confuse others. Queues follow FIFO principle meaning First In First Out.
