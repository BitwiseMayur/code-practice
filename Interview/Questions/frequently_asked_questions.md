1. Python always called an easy language. Will you agree with it?
	Yes, many people consider Python to be an easy and beginner-friendly programming language. There are several reasons for this perception:
Readable and Concise Syntax, Extensive Standard Library, Communtiy Support, Interpreted Language

2. What are the pitfalls and problems of Python language?
While Python is a powerful and widely used programming language, like any language, it has its share of pitfalls and challenges like
* Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python's Global Interpreter Lock can be a bottleneck in multithreaded programs, as it allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time
* Performance: While Python is generally easy to write and read, it may not be as performant as some compiled languages like C or C++. This can be a concern for computationally intensive tasks or applications where high performance is crucial.
* Version Compatibility: The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 created some compatibility issues, and for a while, there were applications and libraries that were not compatible with Python 3. While the community has largely migrated to Python 3, there are still some legacy systems running Python 2.
* Memory Consumption: Python can be memory-intensive, which might be a concern for applications running on resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or certain cloud platforms.
